<h1>CollegeCalc</h1>

This project is designed to take the emotions out of college funnelling and selection; it accomplishes this through the multiple stages of "UPA's" or University Prioritization Algorithms.<br>
Disclaimer: This project is for purposes of learning python through a project, as many sections of the programmes are inefficient (using arrays to store rankings and percentages rather than classes). The information output should only be percieved as an aid.
